## Overview

`hii` helps test and understand behavior of Hydra by generating a variety of posts via keypress.

Originally written while trying to make a minimal python version of `hydrad`. Then used to understand why chunks were not being written in some cases.

Uses python bindings for Hydra and Czmq(for Zchunk structure) generated by zproject.

Post mimetypes and contents:

|content | mimetype   |    format        | comments
|--------|------------|------------------|-----------
|image   | image/jpeg |    zchunk        | image with words overlaid
|image   | text/plain |    base64 string | 
|words   | text/plain |    string        | /usr/share/dict/words 
|file    | text/zpl   |    file?         | TODO

Post Subject is a prefix followed by 3 random words

Parent_id is currently empty. See `hii` arrow key bindings for future navigation and creation of associations.

## Install

1. **Build Hydra** 

    Build & install libraries as listed in Hydra README.

    Currently, this may be the most recent fork of Hydra:  
    ```
    https://github.com/galencm/hydra
    ```

2. **Install python modules.**

    ```
    pip3 install --user Pillow
    pip3 install --user curtsies
    pip3 install --user pytest
    ```  
    Hii uses Pillow for generating images, curtsies for handling keyboard input and pytest for tests.  

3. **Clone repository and run**

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/galencm/hii
    cd hii/
    pytest
    ./hii 
    ```
4. **(if missing) Install Unifont**

    `hii` uses unifont for the text overlays on generated images

    * debian package
        ```
        sudo apt-get install ttf-unifont
        ```

    * fedora package
        ```
        sudo dnf install unifont-fonts
        ```

    * download and install from file(s)
    ```
    wget http://unifoundry.com/pub/unifont-10.0.06/font-builds/unifont-10.0.06.ttf
    wget http://unifoundry.com/pub/unifont-10.0.06/font-builds/unifont_upper-10.0.06.ttf
    sudo mkdir /usr/share/fonts/unifont/
    sudo mv unifont-10.0.06.ttf  /usr/share/fonts/unifont/
    sudo mv unifont_upper-10.0.06.ttf  /usr/share/fonts/unifont/
    ```
## <a name="note"></a> Hydra debug notes

* Hydra Service directory structure

    By default Hydra stores files in a `.hydra` directory created(if not found) wherever service is running. The subdirectories will be created(if not found) as needed.

    ```
    .hydra
    .hydra/peers
    .hydra/posts
    .hydra/blobs
    ```
* Watch directories for filesystem changes using `inotifywait` 
    
    ```
    inotifywait -e modify,create,delete -r .hydra/ -m
    ```  
    (run in parallel with pytest to see basic process)

* Diff binaries using `vbindiff`

    ```
    vbindiff .hydra/posts/blobs/file_foo ../file_bar
    ```
