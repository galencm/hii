## Overview

`hii` helps test and understand behavior of Hydra by generating a variety of posts via keypress.

Originally written while trying to make a minimal python version of `hydrad`. Then used to understand why chunks were not being written in some cases.

Uses python bindings for Hydra and Czmq(for Zchunk structure) generated by zproject.

Post mimetypes and contents:

|content | mimetype   |    format        | comments
|--------|------------|------------------|-----------
|image   | image/jpeg |    zchunk        | image with words overlaid
|words   | text/plain |    string        | /usr/share/dict/words 
|file    | text/zpl   |    file?         | TODO

Post Subject is a prefix followed by 3 random words

Parent_id is currently empty. See `hii` arrow key bindings for future navigation and creation of associations.

## Install

1. **Build Hydra** 

    Build & install libraries as listed in Hydra README.

    Currently, this may be the most recent fork of Hydra:  
    ```
    https://github.com/galencm/hydra
    ```

2. **Install python modules**

    ```
    pip3 install --user Pillow
    pip3 install --user curtsies
    pip3 install --user pytest
    ```  
    Hii uses Pillow for generating images, curtsies for handling keyboard input and pytest for tests.  
3. **Clone repository and run**

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/galencm/hii
    cd hii/
    pytest -v
    ./hii 
    ```
    To see image generated from unicode overlay test:
    ```
    pytest -v --eye
    ```
    The default viewer used by Pillow is `display`, part of imagemagick. If test fails install imagemagick: `sudo apt-get install imagemagick` or `sudo dnf install imagemagick`

4. **(if missing) Install Unifont**

    `hii` tries to use unifont for the text overlays on generated images. 

    Run to see if installed:
    ```
    fc-list | grep unifont
    ```

    * debian package
        ```
        sudo apt-get install ttf-unifont
        ```

    * fedora package
        ```
        sudo dnf install unifont-fonts
        ```

    * download and install from file(s)
    ```
    wget http://unifoundry.com/pub/unifont-10.0.06/font-builds/unifont-10.0.06.ttf
    wget http://unifoundry.com/pub/unifont-10.0.06/font-builds/unifont_upper-10.0.06.ttf
    sudo mkdir /usr/share/fonts/unifont/
    sudo mv unifont-10.0.06.ttf  /usr/share/fonts/unifont/
    sudo mv unifont_upper-10.0.06.ttf  /usr/share/fonts/unifont/
    ```

5. **(if missing) Install words**
    `hii` uses /usr/share/dict/words as a source for text.

    If the file is not found, `hii` will always use the text: "words not found"

    A raspberry pi running rasbpian does not seem have a words file installed by default.

    * debian package
        ```
        sudo aptitude install wordlist
        ```
        will show a metapackage with choices of words to install

    * fedora package
        ```
        sudo dnf install unifont-fonts
        ```

    * diy
        create a text file with one word per line. The following command overwrites any existing words
        ```
        sudo mv yourwords.txt /usr/share/dict/words
        ```

## <a name="note"></a> Hydra debug notes

* Hydra Service directory structure

    By default Hydra stores files in a `.hydra` directory created(if not found) wherever service is running. The subdirectories will be created(if not found) as needed.

    ```
    .hydra
    .hydra/peers
    .hydra/posts
    .hydra/blobs
    ```
* Watch directories for filesystem changes using `inotifywait` 
    
    ```
    inotifywait -e modify,create,delete -r .hydra/ -m
    ```  
    (run in parallel with pytest to see basic process)

* Diff binaries using `vbindiff`

    ```
    vbindiff .hydra/posts/blobs/file_foo ../file_bar
    ```
